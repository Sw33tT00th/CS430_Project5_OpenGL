# CS430_Project5_OpenGL

The reader requires a P6 .ppm file such as the one in the repo.

To run simply enter "make all" then "./bin/image_viewer &lt;filename&gt;.ppm"
If you don't provide a file it will default to out.ppm which is in this repo
To use a different image simply replace the provided image with another P6 image of the same name

Controls are as follows:

	- Arrow keys = translations
	- W and S = scale
	- Q and E = shear
	- A and D = rotate


NOTE: This was developed and tested on OSX
